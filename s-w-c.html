        <p>Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.
            Okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this. Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports.
            You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
            Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner. Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..
            You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. What? You're far too trusting.</p>
